# REINFORCE/VPG

In this repository, a discrete vanilla policy gradient algorithm written from scratch using numpy has been applied to Open AI Gym's Frozen Lake Environment.

Policy gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning techniques that rely upon optimizing parametrized policies with respect to the expected return (long-term cumulative reward) by gradient descent
Vanilla policy gradient also known as REINFORCE is the simplest form of policy gradient methods.

A random policy looks like as follows:

After training with REINFORCE, the policy at best looks like this:
